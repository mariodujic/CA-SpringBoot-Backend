  "text" : "With origins spanning back thousands of years, the Catholic religion has long been one of the most popular on the planet. Nearly every country on the earth has a Catholic population, and the Bible is the most widely read and purchased book in the world. The religion has a rich history, and there is a lot to know about the Roman Catholic Church and those involved with it. \n\nThere are the principles of the faith, the words and teachings of the Bible, the hierarchy of leaders, history of the church and so much more. While there is a lot to learn, Catholic schools, books, church, and several other resources do an excellent job of explaining the history of Catholicism and what it means to be a Catholic. \n\nBut just how much do you know (or remember) about Catholicism? Do you know how many popes there have been throughout history? How about the language in which the Bible was initially written? Whether you want to prove your Catholic knowledge is worthy of being a Saint, or want to learn a little more about the religion, this quiz is for you. ",

Anglophone countries include the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and a number of Caribbean nations. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use English as their first language), which is the largest after Mandarin and Spanish. About 220 million more people use it as their second language. It is often used in work and travel, and there are at least a billion people who are learning it. This makes English the second most spoken language, and the most international language in the world.\n\nNow that we have learned something, it's time to test our knowledge! ",
